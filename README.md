# Unity-projects
I made these during peak COVID times when everyone was home. After watching some tutorials on Unity I wanted to make a game that would ivolve solving puzzels 
with a rocket launcher. In a few days I was able to get the player moving, the players first person camera moving, and a fuctioning cannon that woudld shoot cannon balls and cause invisible 
explosions. I never ended up finishing the project due to school starting up but it was a fun little project to keep me occupied during covid.
